#Kurosaki HTML5 Audio Player with Retina Display Support

Kurosaki HTML5 Audio Player is written in Pure JavaScript. No JavaScript library needed. It uses HTML5 <audio> tag, and adds its own controls to every tag its used on. If HTML5 <audio> tag has controls attribute specified, Kurosaki HTML5 Audio Player removes this attribute, and adds its own controls.
